# Document spec — feat

## Purpose

Produce an organized technical delta for the merge-gate human. The doc
must let the reviewer understand what changed and why it is correct
without reading the raw diff.

## Conditional section template

Include a section **only** when that change-kind exists in the diff.
Omit sections that have nothing to say — an empty section is worse than
no section.

### What shipped

One short paragraph: the ticket's goal and the approach taken. Anchored
in what the diff actually contains, not what the plan intended.

### Surface changes

Include only the subsections that apply:

#### Endpoints / APIs

New or changed HTTP endpoints, RPC methods, SDK public functions. For
each: signature, HTTP method + path, what it does, any auth requirement.

#### Schemas & data

New or changed database tables, JSON schemas, dataclass/Pydantic models,
serialization formats. For each: name, fields added/removed/changed,
migration notes if any.

#### Components / pages

New or changed UI components or pages. For each: component name, where
it renders, key props/state, visual behavior.

#### CLI / workflows

New or changed CLI commands, flags, scripts, or automation workflows.
For each: command, flags, what it does, example invocation.

### Behavior & breaking changes

Changes that alter observable behavior or break callers/consumers:
removed fields, changed defaults, renamed symbols, altered control flow.
If none: omit this section entirely.

### How it was verified

Map each acceptance criterion to the test evidence from the test stage's
output. Format: criterion → evidence (test name, assertion, or
observation). Vague evidence ("tests pass") does not satisfy this
section — name the specific test or output line.

### Review notes

Anything the reviewer should pay special attention to: non-obvious design
decisions, deferred items, known edge cases left in place.

### File map

One line per changed file: `path/to/file.py — why it changed`.
Omit generated files (lock files, compiled assets) unless they carry
semantic meaning.

## Contract rules

1. **Anchored in the actual diff.** Every claim in the doc must be
   verifiable from `git diff main...HEAD`. Do not document the plan's
   intentions — document what the diff contains.

2. **Organized delta, not a diff dump.** Prose explains intent; code
   snippets are short and purposeful. Copying multi-hundred-line hunks
   into the doc violates this rule.

3. **Bounded length.** The doc should be readable in under ten minutes.
   Prefer one clear sentence over three hedging ones. No padding.

4. **No future-work speculation.** Do not describe what could be added
   next, what the system will eventually support, or what is planned for
   later. If README or architecture docs are now stale, note that as a
   suggested follow-up in `Review notes` — do not edit those files.

## Definition of done

- `docs/changes/<ticket-id>.md` exists and is committed on the ticket
  branch.
- Every included section is anchored in the diff.
- All four contract rules satisfied.
- Working tree clean after the commit.
